* I-D its-all-about-linkability

As long as we're sending packets around with the same src IP addr
field being used for a whole lot of different things, these different
things are linkable and if any information at any destination is
linkable to you, you're linked to everything you've done using that
src addr.

The same goes for other [entities] linked to your person, like the
fingerprint of your web browser and [more examples].

[scope?]

- spatial and temporal linkability?
  - temporal, examples
    - src ip; send email using a given ip addr and email addr, later
      use another ip addr but the same email addr;
      person <-> src ip <-> email addr

    - browser fp; browser visiting one site and later another site -- 
  - spatial, examples
    - [todo]

Yup. And as long as you need an answer, you're stuck with that.
(Modulo changing your source address, but with BCP38 networks
doing uRPF, you're limited in what you can do, and your MAC
addr will also give things away to those nearby.)

Yup.

I think it'd get tricky to define some good goals here - clearly
most people do not want full unlinkability. One could argue that
most people's activities ought be less linkable though. Hard to
draw a good line there.

I get what you mean. Maybe its two things: topological and
cross-layer (or cross-application) linkages?

Topological linkage for example would include when TB sends out
packets with the src addr from my home lan when I reboot in work
the next day.

Cross-layer would be when the same MAC is used with different
src IPs, or when the different src IPs are used to access my
very own web server host via SSH.

Cross-application might be different or not, but would include
things like the netflix competition correlation.

Sure. I think in the first instance it'd be good to do that in
terms of extending rfc 6973 if you think that makes sense.

You'll be there? Great. Any idea if other Tor folk will also?

Did we start working on a design for TLS-minus-the-warts yet? Should we
bring such a thing to the IETF or would that be creating more trouble
than it would solve? Could it be used as a way of putting pressure on
the TLS wg, given they care at all about what protocol Tor uses? I guess
probably not.

Did we enumerate all things problematic with TLS somewhere? The
protocol, not any particular implementation. In Berlin I overheard Jake
discuss some of our current issues with ekr, who was not expressing
immediate disgust in any of the suggestions ("superencrypt" to avoid
fingerprinting, an argument for adopting Salsa20 and at least one more
thing that I have forgotten).


| Somebody should do something about the RNG problem. Unfortunately, the
| most problematic platforms (windows, phones) probably wouldn't listen.

A list of all the major PRNG implementations with solid technical
arguments would maybe be something that the IETF could adopt. That could
make a difference.

I think that the RNG issue is going to become even more important when
we start pushing towards more ephemeral keys.

I agree and I'd like to find out. I've talked to at least two
experienced IETFers who say they want to help Tor. They are Hannes
Tschofenig and Stephen Farrell, both on the perpass@ list. Would you be
willing to try figuring this out with their help? Please let me know if
you'd like an introduction in a non-public thread.

Hi,

Picking up a thread from 1,5 years ago.

The world has changed even more now. Jake made a pretty huge impression
on some of the oldies in the IETF community in Berlin this summer. I'd
like to try to follow up at IETF88 in Vancouver, November 3-8, but I'm
not sure how this should be done and if I can do it all by myself. I
welcome more people to join and/or provide some ideas or even material
here.

I have a couple of questions in an email to this list from Sep 10
too. Anyone want to take a shot at them?

Also, Nick, did you ever write that blog post?

I think this is the right thing, but only if you (or a substantial set
of Roger Dingledines or Paul Syversons) do too.

The SAAG chairs Stephen Farrell <stephen.farrell@cs.tcd.ie> and Sean
Turner <turners@ieca.com> are the one I think that you should start
talking to. They have multiple times offered to help with all the IETF
specific nitty-gritty of writing drafts.


| Or maybe I should just start rewriting our specs in my Copious Spare Time.

I should have time to help with that, if you think that would be of help.

| Ah. Apparently I'm the person who *did* answer the other time.

You answered the first email, yes. Thanks.

The follow up questions are in Message-ID: <87y575t9ih.fsf@nordberg.se>
(sorry for messing up with the threads in my email from yesterday). 

A quick summary of my questions:

1. Is there a design for an option to TLS and should we bring such a
thing to the IETF?

2. Do we have a list of all things problematic with TLS?

3. Do we have a list of major PRNG implementations with comments on
their security?

4. What are the alternatives to NIST standards? Something from ECRYPT II?

5. Shall I put you or some other Tor people in touch with Stephen
Farrell, Sean Turner or Hannes Tschofenig? They want to help us.

        are a bunch of items.  Some of them , I've heard that people already                                           
        want to have in TLS 1.3:                                        [17:56]

      though. i can bring up issues though, and try to argue.
<nickm> For example, encrypt as much of the handshake as possible. Encrypt                                             
        record types. Support the ciphers I like (agl is already pushing for

<Yawning> (not that it's uncommon or problematic for tls)               [18:05]

        are adding things that are hard to implement in constant time in pure                                          
        C.  No new ciphers or suites should get added unless the proponent can                                         
        point to constant-time implementations of those things on several

<ln5> nickm: "encrypt packet boundaries"? what is that?
<nickm> err, make that "encrypt TLS record boundaries".  Basically, right now                                          
        in TLS it's clear what the record sizes are.  This makes some content                                          
        fingerprinting attacks a little easier to run.                  [18:21]

## Tuesday Session
### ALPN review [Stephan Friedl and Andrei Popov]
Stephen Friedl presenting
WG member are encouraged to review and provide feedback.
?? Chang : This won't work with session resumption.
Stephen Friedl  : It will not work unless you renegotiate.
EKR : You can't change the cert and ALPN codepoints, but you can resume.
Michael Tuexun : Is there a reason you don't provide this for a general mechanism?
SF : You need to register the name.
MT : I want some binary data in there, is there a reason you did it this way?
SF : We did it because the port number is not reasonable to have different
Roberto Peon : This is there to negotiate the protocol, of anything else would be very strange.
Mike Bishop : There is another extension that can be used for passing arbitrary application data, but I cannot recall the RFC number
 **  RFC 4680 **
Sean Turner : If we're going to make it expert review, should it be only security or only apps or some combination?
Yoav Nir : Expert review should be in security because it can be used for other protocols.
Eliot Lear : When my mother offered chocolate or vanilla, I always took both.
Mark Nottingham : I was concerned about how registration works, but I think we're ok there now.
### HPACK review [Roberto Peon]
Actions by the Security folk to review and analyze.  Mark and Stephen to discuss how to get adequate review, now that the documents have settled down.
EKR : Is it correct that the attack is effectively a brute force attack if you can't guess the secret.  Are you saying that is weaker now?
Roberto Peon : I'm saying that was weaker when you are using a stream compressor.
EKR : The minute you guess the entire thing you're done.
EKR : You are assuming the secret is a high-entropy value.
Stephen Farrel : Do we know someone good at analyzing it?
RP : There are a few people have looked into it.  It was not about HPACK, but on the general use of Huffman.
Stephen Farrell : What is the timeframe that an analysis is useful?
RP : It's always easy to compress nothing.
NM : For the WG, we wanted to finish this up by next year, and we're on track.  We are getting implementation experience.  If we get this done by middle of next year, and it explodes, then we'll have problems.  But this is something we can get fixed with HTTP/2.1 or its successor.  This protocol needs to be easier to version.
Stephen Farrel : So we really want analysis within the next six months.
Yoav Nir : This table needs to be in both the client and server, and needs to be rather large.  It's possible that the table might not be optimal in the future.
RP : We could just go with plaintext encoding, or we use another table or version the protocol.  We know that it's possible to transmit a new table, but we're not sure it's really worhtwhile right now.
EKR : On the threat model, most of the chosen plaintext attacks have exploited some functionality of protocol to repeated induce response.  As you suggest, cookies could use arbitrary entropy.  What we need to be observant about is other forms of data that are lower entropy that you can get clients to send repeatedly, like credit cards, passwords, and PINs.
RP :  I agree the smaller the thing the easier it is.  If I have to guess a PIN, then I think their security model is already broken.
EKR : We are changing the security model somewhat.
NM : I think it's worth explain our proposal on cookie crumbs.
RP : We're looking at breaking cookies, but it's not clear this is making things easier or harder.  If the encoder is naive and puts a small secret on its own, then you've reduced the total secrecy.
Jim Rosekind : IFirst interesting to note that the uncompressed case calls for the client to ask repeatedly, and some servers will get pissed off about that. 
JR : Second thought is about using the static table. If the result took a data set, and you run this numerous times and analyse the space you actually need to explore.
RP : That was something the paper I talked about earlier, one could pare down the state space based on the bits on the wire.  It was a very small reduction -- it was still exponential.
Stephen Farrel  :  I'm wondering if the headers would be impacted by this.
RP : One of the things about having a compressor like this is people might use larger secrets, because the cost is less.
Paul Hoffman : I think you'll need to solicit for those reviews outside of just security.
Stephen Farrel : Between us we should try to find some way of getting review.
Lucy Lynch :  There are a lot of people around that have experience in this, but not exactly in the same problem space.
Jim Rosekind : when you look at this pseudo random cookies that actually use a pattern.  Using a greater amount of entropy can reduce the benefit from huffman encoding.
RP : With all due respect, you're wrong (-:  This is generally base64 encoding, so it's already reduced.
JR  : You're right that is using a reduced input set, but the tables might not favor some of the inputs.
YN : I thought one of the goals is to change to use binary encodings.
RP : We can't quite do that because of interop problems with 1.1
RP : Right now, the Huffman tables are different for requests and responses.  The differences are noticable, and we've have talked about using a third table for cookies, but we haven't seen a good benefit there.  We haven't actually seen the compressiong being larger so far.
JR : It is much more plausible if you're using ASCII characters in unif ways, but once you bring in the english language it gets easier.
RP : I agree but we haven't tried that yet for complexity reasons.  We haven't made an issue for that yet.
Martin Thomson : There's plenty of places that such things show up, not just cookies.
RP : Part of the problem for attackers is you don't know where the secret is.
### Encryption and HTTP/2 + Opportunistic Encryption
 Mark Nottingham presenting
 
 ** NOTE: slides are _NOT_ on the materials page**
Ted Hardie : One of the big questiosn from yesterday was why would anyone want an HTTP/2 connection that was plaintext.  If we can go from two states to two by eliminating the cleartext then we're in a better place.
#### Alternate Proposal for Discovery
Paul Hoffman presenting
Use DNS to determine if the server for http: likely has a TLS equivalent, instead of using HTTP headers.  The two are not necssarily orthogonal.  This is a mechanism difference, not a conceptual difference.
Phil Haram-Baker : In my proposal, you can find the information in DNS because that's what DNS is for.  The guidance could be used for multiple services.
MN : And that's why we described this in two separate layers.  One is what to do, the other is how to figure out if you can.
RP : We experimented with something like this a long time ago, and I'm not interested in hearing about the mechanisms, but I'm much more interested in knowing if this increases our overal security.  I'm not sure this actually increases the aggregate security.  This third level might actually decrease security because it confuses users.  It might make people thing that opportunistic encryption is good enough when it actually isn't.  I used to think this was a good idea.
William Chan : I talked to various people on the Chrome team, and there some concerned about the relaxed mode.  We're more interested in doing authentication always, even for HTTP:  I am quite excited for encryptiong HTTP URIs.
NM : I would love to have the authentication.  If we can good get good deployment, then it's great.  From a se
EL : Concerned this introduces a new form of MitM.  If yu have this header, that now says you can use relaxed, a MITM can insert the header or replace a 301 with a header, and the server thinks it has an encrypted tab but is really sending data through the MITM.
EL : Why would the attacker not just proxy HTTP, and I'm just saying this is another avenue.  I'm also not sure we understand the consequences of adding a new property about saying "don't bother to verify the certificate" and confusion about unathenticated encryption versus authenticated encryption.
Salvatore ?? : I am worried we are putting to many things together, and changing things on the fly.  It might be too much to manage.
NM : I think this is been kind of implicit in everything we do, because we might be switching to a new connection protocol.
YN : I think there is value protecting against passive attacks.  Active attacks are 10x more expensive.  I don't see much point in having authentication for HTTP because we have HTTPS.  Having encryptiong wihtout encryption has some value, as long as user-agents don't say you've got protection.
Larry Masinter : I was thinking about cases where encryption might introduce excessive overhead, and one is delivery of video.  There is value in encrypting the headers, though.
MN : This is a negotiation -- the client can request it, and the server can offer it.
RP : It is incorrect to say there is not benefit to encrypting video.  It is useful for the content provider and for the distributer.
Tim Bray : I tell most people to just use TLS.  For you information, the arguments against encryption are becoming less and less convincing.  I think we should keep pushing the rock uphill because we're starting to win.
MN : One of the conclusions we have is whether server authentication needs to be lumped in.  Does that mean we push everyone to just use HTTPS, or is there still benefit to HTTP.
Rohan Mahy : A lot of concerns are about what the user experience.  To me it's clear -- if you are doing HTTPS, then here's the list of things to get the green locked icon.  if it's HTTP, then there's no immediate indication.  You just do it, and not tell enybody about it in the default case.
NM : By the way, that's what's in the draft.
Alissa Cooper : We should think of this as a gift to users (-:
Ted Hardie : I like the idea of not giving the browesr a signal of opportunisitc encryption.  But users are not the only side in this.  There are classes of software that might provide a false sense of security.  We can get a benefit, but it might cost us some authenticated encryption, and that is a serious problem.  I think we should just do HTTP/2.o is always authenticated encryption.  If we can't get to server authentication always, then make it hard or hidden to do opportunistic.
Brian Dixon : From the perspective of opportunistic, it should be acceptable to use self-signed, but still require authentication.  This might lower the bar, but this might still be of benefit.
Patrick McMannus : People don't always have all the information about what the protection there is if we rely on HTTPS only, so having encryption always is a good thing.  I think it's better to require authenticated, since we really just get one chance.  But if all we can really do is HTTP-relaxed, then it's still moving the bar forward.
?? : Most browsrs give you a place to enter certain configuration options on a per-host basis.  While I don't think we should expose this to users, but I think there is benefit.
Johan ?? : I'm a little skeptical of doing encryption at this level.  Especialy as it plays with DNS.
Richard Barnes : Unauthenticated encryption is the new plaintext.  This means that the worst case is that you are protected from passive attacks.  We should shoot for authenticated encryption.  If our goal is to increase the number of places that authentication and integrity protection is increased, I'm not sure these goals get us there.  If we require authentication, it means people need to get the proper credentials at scale, but we're not there right now.
Christian Huitema : I am skeptical about the amount of protection you really get.  I am concerned about the case where we first send the request in cleartext, with all of the potential traffic analisys information exposed, is not providing any benefit.  We should think about the security considerations about this, and maybe have other ways of determining this information, or require another trip in order.
NM : We did talk about this in Seattle, and if people are going to do this for security purposes, then you would block this data.  Such as sending a very minimal amount of infomration in an exloratory request or use DNS.
RP :  I want to point out why people don't deploy HTTPS.  It's not because of the cost of getting certs, but because HTTPS is significantly slower.  People doing commerce are very interested in performance, and are unlikely to deploy unless HTTP2/ with TLS is as fast or faster. Our experimentation at Google has shown that HTTPS is as fast or faster for a large number of cases.
RP : < note taker missed it >
Stephen Friedl : I agree with Roberto.  I don't trust locks on my browsers, and heaven forbid I explain to laymen.  The only way to do this is HTTPS (with authentication) only.  No more HTTP.  And we should be rigorous about it.  I am in the camp to push everything to HTTPS except for the small set of cases where it doesn't make sense.  For ALPN, we should be more formal of how to register the types.
Rob Trace : I would like to have a secure web, but there is a long list of corner cases where it's applicable to have HTTP plaintext.  It's hard to claim this is a security feature, since you still have to treat the content in and out as insecure.
EKR : Is HTTP/2-over-TLS only still on the table?
MN : It appears that the position of HTTP/2. over only TLS is too extreme.
EKR : Doing nothing is stupid.  What I think we're arguing about is whether having the relaxed version lowers the bar too much.  I think determining how many would do the right thing, or at least do opportunistic is tricky and we don't know.  I think opportunistic TLS is worth doing.
MN : People have expressed concern about confusing people about the security state, and I don't think that will be the case.  Server admins will open a browser and look for the indicators.  If there are none, then they don't think they have any protection.  As for commernce, I'm not sure that's an important thing anymore.  What's important is what happens out-of-the-box.  If any encryption requires doing more than installing the software then people won't be doing it most times.
EL :  One of the thigns I was thinking about was to do the discovery inline instead of a referall mechanisms.  I think having all the security and HTTP people helps informs the discussion for perpass.  A few people made some economic assertions,  these are  interesting questions for researchers to look into.  Also, the IRTF meeting is discussing how to get researchers and those willing to pay for it together.
PHB : The original goal for HTTPS was to have the same level of trust for people buying things online as buying things in a store.  So not turning on the lock if you haven't authenticated is good.  Deploying opportunistic TLS increases the work attacks have to do which is good.  But for the other attacks, where someone could downgrade someone from HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1.  Do you really want to re-encrypt YouTube vidoes each time?
AUDIENCE : YES
PHB : Once you get past that, you are really talking about doing strong crypto or crappy crypto.  You could probably collapse the work factors to one or two choices.
Keith Moore : The decision this WG is making has a long term effect.  I think we need to look beyond the current threat or the past threats.  Right now active attacks are harder than passive attacks.  But if a passive attack is feasible, then an active attack is also feasible.  I'm not sure there's a benefit to do opportunistic because you can be downgraded, unless you can absolutely prevent it.
TH : What Keith said, but also this is an estimation problem (as EKR pointed out).  We are taking the current state and adding opportunistic encryption, which prevents FireSheep.  Does adding opportunistic reduce the number of times people get good certs?
EKR: If we provide the unauth mechanism, [EKR line noise]
TH: If we ask "should HTTP/2.0 be TLS-only?" we might come to a different conclusion.
RP : My definition of commerce might be very different of yours.  Pintrest doesn't actually sell anything, but they still add value.  Commerce doesn't always mean adding things to a cart and checking out.  Pintrest doesn't have a competitor right now, but latency matters.  Second, it is far easier to add authentication later than to remove unauthentication later.  If we weaken it by adding this third thing it will be hard to fix.
?? : Trying to protect against just the passive attack is silly.  One thing is very clear is that if I have a HTTP URI, I want to try to use it in a secure way.  If I use it in a secure way, I want to really be secure.
MN : If we did do opportunistic, do you want to see mitigation of downgrade attack. [Yes]
Stephen Farrel : I think there's value in trying to mitigate the passive attack, so I think the do nothing option is really stupid.  Trying to insist on HTTPS everywhere is not feasible or scalable.  I think the third option is the right approach.
MN : I think we have an opportunity to improve performance with HTTP/2
Will Chan : One barrier I've heard is about mixed content.  Even though I'm a big fan of telling people to just use HTTPS, but I need third-party ads and what do I do?  While I want to got HTTPS only, I think there's still a lot of benefit because it reduces the barrier of entry.
EKR :  I think you should consider option 0, and you consider TLS for HTTP/2 always.  I think we should do something, and having some option for the server to indicate it only wants to do the authenticated mode.  Is it ok to have mixed content?  We need to consider the policies that are involved in these cases.
PHB : I think a lot of the argument is over a choice that doesn't exist.  One is whether you have authenticated cert or not, since the IETF doesn't strongly define what authenticated really means.  The only choice that can be made is whether the client can be allowed to turn off its root criteria.
Roy Fielding : I don't think you can require HTTP/2 to be encrypted always, given all the places that HTTP servers are deployed.  I could get behind that if you use HTTP you use a secure transport protocol, ether it's TLS or SSH or something.  I don't think it's a technical argument, but there is a social argument that you can and probably should make.
#### What does the WG Want?
Mark Bishop : Just want to be clear, that for 2 and 3 that there's an option to go better, but no requirement.
LM : One considerations is if users would be presented with information about those connections. Which of these include those dialogs/information?  And what is the performance impact?
Dixon : To clarify server auth, it should include both CA-based and DANE-based.
Rohan Mahy: I don't know what #3 means with the word somehow, especially in a technical context.
Gabriel Montenago : Remember what the desired final state is to increase the use of valid TLS.  Where is that in these choices?  I think plaintext has an important place in the world.
Barry Leiba : You should be looking for who cannot live with some of these.

- nick feamster presenting 
- we don't know how widespread the internet censorship is, see ONI

- reasons for it: political stability (UK), national security (US) ,

  - "i did a bad thing" (i was late)
  - objectives
  encrypt as much of the handshake as possible
  reduce handshake latency
  reevaluate handshake contents
  reevaluate record protection mechanisms
  focusing on new handshake flows
  - new handshake flows
    "false start" explained
    falling back under prediction failure
    - reduced RT handshake with privacy
      lots of things from marsh ray
      basically, this is false start with the CCS moved (changecipherspec) up 
      best you could do with a one-RTT handshake

      The Finished message is the first one protected with the just
      negotiated algorithms, keys, and secrets.  Recipients of Finished
      messages MUST verify that the contents are correct.  Once a side

      maybe not problematic bc none of the peers are sending
      application data before it sees Finished?

      making PFS harder, requires renegotiation

- stephen farrell
  it's an attack and that's how we should treat it
  it's not unique -- others are doing the same... or will
  the scale is interesting and new
  a purely technincal response will not solve this but we should treat the attack as we usually do
  affect the cost of pervaisive monitioring
  some of them are short-term "pint changes", otehrs will take time
  - if we're serious, some changes must happen
    MTI vs. more-than-MTI
    confidentiality vs. packet inspectin
    anon/pseudonymity vs. authent/law enforcementent/advertising
  get some changes made or started more easily whil the news is fresh
  but don't so quick we'll do it wrong
  NOTE: "we" is the IETF _and_ each of us when outside the IETF, i.e. when going back to our companies

    webrtc and iot making it all worse?
    fingerprinting and traffic analysis from RF->app layer
    corporate cloudy privacy-busting "will be affected if we succeed"
  - conclusion
    it's an attack, on  a new scale
    goal: make it more expensive
- open mic phb: not only look at defensive; look at the economic

  benefits that they can provide -- look at tls; a real problem with
  bullrun spending money on undermining trust
  
  crocker: thank you, your talks was the right set of things; corp cooperation, how can we do about this , or how would crypto help here, bruce?

  bruce: crypto makes it harder, if it's encrypted They have to after
  only high value targets, the more we use encryption the more we
  raise the coset. encryption makes them have to go after the valued
  targets and not everybody.
  
  james v[?]: bruce says improve target dispersal but farrell didn't
  bring it up; if the ietf wants to help
  
  eliot lear: there are tradeoffs here, "cyber security tradeoffs",
  ietf shouldn't spend too much time on this
  
  ??: i urge everybody to run lots of good stuff in their computers;
  examine all the mailing lists you're on at the IETF and ask about
  security; we made (in DNSSEC) registrars do it even if everybody
  said "there's no demand"; push your providers
  
  charlie perkins: 1. have been asking ppl what will your privacy be
  in five years? none; a PR problem; why is privacy important? 2. we
  need identity management; mobility management; mobile providers
  track every byte you send for charging you , at least that's the
  cover story
  
  erik klein ?: what can we do aobut economic effects? like from 2001,
  evbdy waiting for RSA patents to expire; most ppl charge more for
  SSL; can the tech community do anything about that?
  
  eliot: "great question", bruce can you comment?
  
  bruce: yes, this is hard. we do have incentive issues. the benefits
  accdrue only when many ppl use this and the eary adooters do pay
  more. we _can_ sunset protocols, i.e. forcing ppl to move.
  
  [iab person, with glasses]: i wanna change the economics too, think
  about the automobile, it changed stuff, we can't go back -- ask the
  ppl in detroit; i wonder if we've introduced a change here
  
  ??: what are the threats to devices, as opposed to laptops and phonees? 
  
  farrell: crypto is availlable; look at ipsec, works in tiny amount of code
  
  bruce: i'm worried about the internet of things; it increases [?],
  think about cell phones, they are trackers, they have better motion
  sensors and stuff; looking at it individually doesn't say much but
  look at the big picture; talking about issues [...]
  
  jari: not too worried about the devices, more worrited about the
  data from the devices; think of gmail - a single database with all
  the data about all of us; think of things being distributed
  
  swemike: failure mode of dnssec is bad, how to we expoose the
  failure modes to the user? if it doesn't work, users is going to
  turn it off; where do wanna be in five years and how does it work
  from a users PoV? usability expoerts here?
  
  [iab person, bearded, far right on stage]: good point, strong challenge
  
  murray, channeling queswtion from home: scope was staggering (snowden); what's the takeaway form al lthis?
  
  bruce: robust system, so many ways to get at our data, simultaneously
  
  stephen: describing the threat model
  
  questioner: were we too narrow up until now?
  
  farrell: lots of things at teh same time, we didnt anticipate that
  
  sam hartman: we are enablers (as technologists) and we do that, from
  ; what to do? 1. clear that any attack is possible and when someone
  says "who's going to do that?" reply "they will!". 2. encryption
  even w/o authn has value -- opportunistic enc is valuable; 3. enable
  things -- we shouldn't decide what market does, same for cloud stuff
  -- enable for decentralized solutions
  
  brian t[?]: respond to bruce: policy is not very ood at looking at
  the big picture; well we're not either. when increasing enc we also increase siloing. how can we decrease the problem of not looking at the big picture?
  
  stephen: lok at tls 1.3 and ekrr's 
  
  [iab person]: if we put too strong enc in some government will not connect to internet
  
  ??: anhy project providing funding for [?]
  
  bruce: i disagree: math is on the dfeenders side; there are tech
  things ou can do; agree, lots of things are political and
  international political
  
  brian carpenter: defuse the political debate by providing the good
  tech increasing security
  
  wes h[?]: private conversation with my wife; send her a text,
  realized i can't send this, "this airport is dead" was the gthing i
  didn't think was a good thing to send; we've been architecting under
  two thoughts: 1. centralizing everything; two things have
  changed 1. with ipv6 we can get to things directly, no care abt NT,
  and we need to ...; 2. we're now online all the time, f.ex. SMTp
  servers were needed bc nothing else was online, but now it isö
  decentralisation
  
  matt må_ knee+jerk reaction is Ämore ecnryptionÄ but we need
  Ämodulated securityÄ. problemÖ providers with strong tls, while ther
  eare laws making f.ex. empoloyers can read email of employeesö
  example where mitms tls at workplaces
  
  stephen: get rid of me before getting tls mitm standardised
  
  eliot: good ideas, mark has a draft
  
  greg [mirsky?]: not only tech, not only national, but international;
  with the internet of things we don't know where data is going to be
  collected; 
  
  jari: infor about where data is stored is imprtant; think hard
  before you use the cloud; IETF should have tools to talk direct and
  distribute data
  
  ??: we depend o f isp and law enforcement; malware or other things,
  we need to keep track, need to handle prlbem, before putting
  encryption we must think abt this
  
  tim [pole?], nist; doing public review of it sstandard process, will
  talk abt that at SAAG tomorrow; an observation: we can do better but
  we have a lot of tools that are not in use today; we security is
  going to cost -- usability, performance; this is only a first step
  
  jari: cost of security and get users to use existing tools is key;
  this is a unique opportunity thanks to the press; grab the
  opprotunity; now is the time
  
  alvestrand: philosphical: the colour black: 1. sadness -- i put on a
  black t-shirt bc i aws a bit sad; 2. what goes on in the darkness
  needs to be hidden -- we make common cause with those who have
  reason to hide; we're seeking to empower those want to hide and
  that's a real cost to society; a a cost we have to take, bu and i
  think is worth it and the action is ; 3. go dark
  
  carpenter: we shouldn't have this discussion
  
  [chair]: i don't want my emoployeeeeeeer to know when i talk to myu doctor
  
  ??: i spoke on internet hardening in 1998; spent the last 15 years
  with scada, aviation things; we don';t give good guidance to build
  good networks; we should help building critical infrastructure; form
  a wG on critical infrastructure networking
  
  dean l[?]: translation: encryption is like birthday cake -- the more
  layers the tastier but the more meesy to eat; companies have to
  operate acdording to law and avoid law suit; unique position to help
  say best practices for networks; companies can leatn on what IETF
  says
  
  benoa: yes, there is a market for [?]
  
  dean: we need to adopt, suspecxtability to pervasive surveillance; 
  
  [jeff?]: never let a good vuln go to waste -- let's use this
  knowledge to get better; we're on te right way; lots of soft
  targetrs out there, like quality of ipmlementations; what can we do
  in protocl specs to make end result of implementaions harder and
  stronger?
  
  bruce: the more idiot-poof the better. PRNG are loiusey, sw choices
  bad, the less optins to give someone who doesn't know security
  
  eliot: stuff should be designed by geniouses, not for geniouses
  
  mark nottingham: we must allow dispersal; we don't have open
  protocols for dropbox-like services; i want that; perfect is the
  enemy of the good, we have to walk the line btw real good security
  and balkanisation; we might not have the luxuary of being perfect
  
  eliot: spectrum btw very few servers and one server each -- there's
  middle ground; look at your group (httpbis)
  
  ??: q for bruce: ethical issue, i can use tor to start a flame war
  on reddit; different protection need by different ppl
  
  bruce: put tor into some server code to make it more deployed? otr
  is great; granulataret less; safety in numbers! 
  
  paul wouters: i see 2 msgs: 1: pl tell me pls do more opprotunistic
  encryption but i'm saying this in private; 2. your'e doing great but
  i won't tell you in public bc i've taking money from nsa before so
  if i comment your draft will be tainted; pls continue to review
  drafts bc we need to handle this anyway
  
  ??, verizon: 802.180, fiber links, blah blah blah
  
  ??: border protection forced me to open my laptop; scanning for
  child porn; asked me for passphrase and took my comp to secret room
  for half an hour; 
  
  bruce: yeah, we know that. i travel with burner phone and burner computer; 
  
  ted: disagrea with brian. he looked forward to a long debate but we
  don'tnee done; and second the level of neutrality: we're under
  attack. harms the value of the network; it harms humanity; old piece
  of ietf lore, that in plenary can committ to something; hum on "is
  the ietf willing to take the technical steps ..."
  
  brian: attacks on privacy by business and not only by government
  
  peter st andre: practical actions: working to ensure hop-by-hop
  encryption; use our survey and discover that you can make it better;
  ietf will hofeully sign my manifesto; otr is to be standardised,
  with wouters; more p2p might be needed; we have a free society which
  depends on that not everything is public -- ppl will self censor
  
- russ
  
  is the ietf willing to respond to the attack of pervasive
  surveillance? hum says yes.
  
  should we consider this threat model when developing standards [?]: yes
  
  consider encryption even outside authn? yes
  
  ietf should strive for end-to-end encryption even when there are
  middle boxes in the path? mixed but more yes
  
  ietf should create secure versions of popular non-secure protocols:
  mostly yes
  
  kolkman: what are the next steps? broad questions here. sense of the
  room is clear. how are we getting things done?
  
  russ: first, perpass bof and iab and iasg has have a hotspot
  discussion wchih will be about this
  
  jari: next step is that we document this in an RFC. there's more
  nuance in such a document than what we express here.
  
  jerry?: we've standarided on certain opportunistic standards that
  have not been impelemnted; how to change that?

  targeted vs pervasive monitoring
  goal: reverse it; make it so that pervasive monitoring is more costly than targeted
  - goal of surveillance is to collect information
  common reasonse given:
    saves lives, comats crime; protect against viruses, spam, hackers;
    protects against information leaks
  - types of information
  data: files, email content, chat logs
  metadata: address, locatino, timestamps, size, keywoards
  keys: secrets needed to decrypt data or metadata, or to impersonate
    (and then mitm)
  - strategies mentioned
  overly get a cooperating entity to hand over data
  covertly subvert a general service, like an email provider
  covertly subvert targets system and collect the information
  - get keys
    obtain directly
    lower entropy and rak
    use existing known weaknesses
  - points of influence
    trusted roots & cert auth (diginotar)
      get a fake cert for compromised root
      diginotar compromised, issued certs 
      flame used older cert issuing sw to issue bad cert to spoof MS
      debugging tools liek fiddler add another trusted root in order to act as mitm 
    software creators & distributors
      RNG in code often unsafe -- dict attacks
      compromised crypto API might leak key bits
      things like tor shift focus to attacking vuln sw, like a browser
      too little review --> backdoors
      coerced into building in backdoors or handing over keys
      [one more thing]
    data repos (prism)
      compelled to hand over info
      lavabit shut down
      other data like airlines, energy companies, financial orgs
      bank transfers across borders -- SWIFT
      emai lmetadata with two degrees of separation could be obtained
      metadata correlation with other records (eg hotel guest list)
    protocol algorithm designer (dual_ec_dbrg)
      influence to use breakable crypto, eg dual_ec_dbrg (nist)
      influence policies, standards and specs
      fear of influence over standards by govs or companies
    network operators (quantum)
      install surveillance at exchange points, links for customers
      attacker hack into router to redirect traffic to mitm
      redirect target to website that plants malware
    pysical fiber, satellite (muscuilar)
      tap links with physical access
      esp w/o encryption on links btw data centers
    hw designers & factories (esp with IoT (internet of things))
      manufacturere could insert aa backdoor into producet
      insert hw torjans at designer or at factory ==> reduce entropy or leak keys

  four box model
- [httpbis chair] "MORE TLS"
  threat model: passive attacks
  a. opportunistic encryption
    encrypt, don't do authn, don't worry about downgrade, don't tell the user

  1. creating confusion about security
  2. discouraging the full security solution
  3. encouraging active attacks
  4. authn is core part of tls -- don't change it
  
  b. opportunistic encryption with server authn

    protects aginst mitm but sudpectible for downgrade, can be
    mitigated with pinning (maybe)
    
  1. barrier to deployment
  2. perfect is the enemy of the good
  3. might as well do...

  c. tls everywhere
  
    for http: only support http/2.0 for https uris
    combining  with HSTS to mitigate downgrade attacks
  
  1. costly
  2. disempowers intermediaries (proxies)
  3. fragmentation of the internets

    answer: the particular paper has two rngs hash based, one block
    based, one ecc based; the national security community wanted the
    ecc one; we put in the spec that ppl should generate their own

** standardizing onion routing

*** email thread
**** nick 1
To my mind, one big benefit to one or more Informational RFCs
describing Tor would be the rigor of a better-written set of
documents.  Our current specs, though readable, are far from perfect.
I'd hope that better specifications would make it even easier for
others to analyze, update, and improve our protocols.

People already make compatible implementations of the Tor protocols
from time to time. These compatible implementations tend to become
unmaintained fairly quickly--I don't know why that is, but I wouldn't
suspect that our specs are to blame.

I'm a little torn on the benefits of having others build new projects
based on our current protocols.  Our current protocols are, to be
blunt, more or less the sort of thing you'd expect if some talented
but young developers had designed something in a hurry ten years ago
and kept patching it over the years to improve and refine it.  There
are aspects of the protocols that serve no useful purpose besides
backwards compatibility.

What  other benefits would we hope for or expect?


I'm not personally interested in the idea of moving the institutional
responsibility for developing future versions of the Tor protocols in
the future from the IETF. Naturally, we can't stop people from forking
the Tor protocols -- and we wouldn't want to have such authority if it
existed -- but I think the benevolent-dictatorship model serves us
(for now at least) better than the working-group model would.  If I
understand correctly, this means we ought to aim for an Informational
RFC?


The biggest risk would be that someone in the future attempting to
implement Tor-compatible software would aim for compatibility with Tor
as described in the RFC, rather than Tor as implemented on the Tor
network. What could we do to mitigate this risk?


So, how volatile are the Tor protocols exactly?  We keep them
specified version-to-version, and they change a bit in every release
series.  Looking down the list of protocols, there are roughly no
parts that I would be willing to promise never to change in the
future.  In practice, we generally have found it to be no real burden
to support versions of the protocol up to two or three years old, but
we have found it desirable to break backwards compatibility with
things much older than that from time to time.

[Now, to write that other email.]
**** nick 2, replying to stephen
I think that a phone call would be a fine idea.  Or possibly an online
chat, if you're comfortable with that: I find that I am a little
better at communicating nuance in text than in speech.  (To be clear
though, phone would work too.)

Is the logical thing just for a quick two-person chat to get me to
understand what the options are, or should we try to schedule a
multiperson thing?

*** encrypt-then-MAC (EtM) as an AEAD mode
What is AEAD? It's "authenticated encryption with additional
data". Examples in TLS are CCM and GCM.

[i think that] A message encrypted with AEAD can be verified to have
been encrypted with a given key. That's the authentication.

How does it relate to encrypt-then-MAC?
A: AEAD could do EtM.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authenticated_encryption:
  Six different authenticated encryption modes (namely OCB 2.0, Key
  Wrap, CCM, EAX, Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM), and GCM) have been
  standardized in ISO/IEC 19772:2009.

RFC5116:
   It may be desirable to define an AEAD algorithm that uses the generic
   composition with the encrypt-then-MAC method [BN00], combining a
   common encryption algorithm, such as CBC [MODES], with a common
   message authentication code, such as HMAC-SHA1 [RFC2104] or AES CMAC
   [CMAC].  An AEAD algorithm of this sort would reflect the best
   current practice, and might be more easily supported by crypto
   modules that lack support for other AEAD algorithms.

TODO: read, input from Sam, who also asks "why would you want AEAD?"

[[file:~/Persistent/u/ietf/in-notes/rfc5246.txt][RFC5246]]:

   In AEAD encryption, the plaintext is simultaneously encrypted and
   integrity protected.  The input may be of any length, and aead-
   ciphered output is generally larger than the input in order to
   accommodate the integrity check value.

[[file:~/Persistent/u/ietf/internet-drafts/draft-gutmann-tls-encrypt-then-mac-03.txt][Gutmann's draft]]:

3.  Applying Encrypt-then-MAC
[...]
   Note from the GenericStreamCipher/GenericBlockCipher annotation that
   this only applies to standard stream and block ciphers that have
   distinct encrypt and MAC operations.  It does not apply to
   GenericAEADCiphers that already include integrity protection with the
   cipher.  If a server receives an encrypt-then-MAC request extension
   from a client and then selects an AEAD cipher suite, it MUST NOT send
   an encrypt-then-MAC response extension back to the client.

I'm fine with either alternative. What I'd really like to do is
obsolete the existing mac-pad-encrypt construction, and I don' t much
care how.

Rationale: Someday, maybe in a decade or so, TLS 1.2 and earlier will
be dead; it will no longer be necessary for most users to turn them
on, or for most software to implement them. When these versions are
finally gone, it would be great if their mistakes were gone too.  But
unless we either deprecate all existing CBC and stream ciphersuites,
or specify encrypt-then-mac for TLS 1.3, we'll be stuck with the
current nonsense for even longer.

So it seems to me.
