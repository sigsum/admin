eglibc (2.13-25) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting with the eglibc package version 2.13-5, the libraries are 
  shipped in the multiarch directory /lib/<triplet> instead of the more
  traditional /lib, where <triplet> is the multiarch triplet and can be
  retrieved with 'dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_MULTIARCH'. Similarly the
  includes are now shipped in /usr/include/<triplet> instead of the more
  traditional /usr/include.
  
  The toolchain in Debian has been updated to cope with that, and most
  build systems should be unaffected. If you are using a non-Debian 
  toolchain to build your software and it is not able to cope with 
  multiarch, you might try to pass the following options to your 
  compiler:

    -B/usr/lib/<triplet> -I/usr/include/<triplet>
  
  Alternatively if the build system makes hard to pass the above options,
  you might try to set the LIBRARY_PATH and CPATH environment variables:                                                                                                                                                          
    LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/<triplet>
    CPATH=/usr/include/<triplet>
    export LIBRARY_PATH CPATH

eglibc (2.13-7) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with version 2.13, eglibc provides an SSSE3 optimized version 
  of memcpy() on the amd64 architecture. This version might copy memory 
  backward in some conditions, which causes issues if the source and 
  destination overlap. memmove() should be used in such cases, but some 
  programs still wrongly use memcpy().

  For this reason, on the amd64 architecture the Debian package provides 
  two wrappers which can be use to workaround and/or debug the issue:
  - /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc/memcpy-preload.so simply replace all 
    calls to memcpy() by a call to memmove()
  - /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc/memcpy-syslog-preload.so does the same,
    but in addition logs (with rate limit) the issue to syslog, so that it 
    can be detected and fixed.

  To use these wrapper on a single binary, the easiest way is to use the
  LD_PRELOAD environment variable:
  - LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc/memcpy-preload.so /path/to/binary
  - LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc/memcpy-syslog-preload.so /path/to/binary

  For system-wide usage, it is possible to add the path of one of the 
  wrapper to /etc/ld.so.preload.

  For more details about the issue, please see:

apt (0.8.11) unstable; urgency=low

bogofilter (1.2.2-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * If this is a new installation, or if you are upgrading from a
    version prior to 0.93.0-1, you should have no problems.
    If you are using the BDB backend with transactions enabled (they're
    disabled by default), you must manually clean-up your transaction logs
    before it will function again.
  - To do so, first make sure you have the db4.X-util package
    installed, the precise version depending on the Debian release
    you upgrade from:
        * lenny (bogofilter 1.1.7-1): db4.6-util
        * squeeze (bogofilter 1.2.2-2): db4.8-util
        * unstable (bogofilter 1.2.2-2): db4.8-util
  - Then (substitute 4.8 below for the version of your release):
        1. Stop invocation of bogofilter
        2. db4.8_recover -h ~/.bogofilter
        3. rm ~/.bogofilter/lockfi*
        4. cd ~/.bogofilter && rm $(db4.8_archive -h .)
        5. Resume invocation of bogofilter
  - Repeat this upgrade procedure for each relevant bogofilter
    wordlist database, substituting the directory name for
    "~/.bogofilter".
  * Alternately, if you don't want to upgrade your database, you
    may move or delete it and rebuild your wordlist from scratch.

cron (3.0pl1-119) unstable; urgency=low

    The semantics of the -L option of the cron daemon have changed: from
    now on, the value will be interpreted as a bitmask of various log
    selectors, with "1" (log only the start of jobs) being the new default.

    Additionally, since -117 (NEWS entry was overlooked), the LSBNAMES
    variable in /etc/default/cron was merged with the EXTRA_OPTS variable
    as it was redundant.

gconf (3.2.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  GConf 3.x introduces important internal changes that allow it to drop
  obsolete ORBit libraries in favour of a new D-Bus interface.

  While the GConf API remains compatible, after a system running gconfd
  2.32 is upgraded to 3.2, newly launched applications will be unable to
  talk to the old daemon, and will fail to load their configuration.

  Simply restarting your X session will be enough to load the new gconfd
  and restore the affected functionality.

linux-base (3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Some HP Smart Array controllers are now handled by the new 'hpsa'
    driver, rather than the 'cciss' driver.

    While the cciss driver presented disk device names beginning with
    'cciss/', hpsa makes disk arrays appear as ordinary SCSI disks and
    presents device names beginning with 'sd'.  In a system that already
    has other SCSI or SCSI-like devices, names may change unpredictably.

    During the upgrade from earlier versions, you will be prompted to
    update configuration files which refer to device names that may
    change.  You can choose to do this yourself or to follow an automatic
    upgrade process.  All changed configuration files are backed up with
    a suffix of '.old' (or '^old' in one case).

lirc (0.9.0~pre1-1) unstable; urgency=low

    lirc_cmdir has been dropped upstream in favour of a userspace module 
    (commandir). lirc_ene0100, lirc_imon, lirc_mceusb/ lirc_mceusb2 and
    lirc_streamzap have been ported to the new RC_CORE input subsystem, which
    requires different configuration methods and "ir-keytable" for keytable 
    upload.

    lirc-modules-source has been superseded by kernel >= 2.6.37, which has
    merged lirc under staging. Conversion of traditional lirc modules to the
    new RC_CORE subsystem is still ongoing and may require config adaptions for
    newly ported modules.

    The kernel/ userspace ABI between staging lirc modules in the upstream
    kernel and those provided by previous lirc-modules-source packages is not
    compatible, only >= 0.9~ userspace and staging kernel modules from 
    >= 2.6.37 can cooperate.

    lirc-svga (smode2) has been dropped in favour of lirc-x (xmode2) or mode2
    from the main lirc binary.

rsyslog (5.8.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The way rsyslog processes SIGHUP has changed. It no longer does a reload
  of its configuration, but simply closes all open files, which is a much more
  lightweight operation.
  To apply a changed configuration, rsyslogd needs to be restarted now.
  As a consequence, the reload action has been dropped from the init script.

  A new action called "rotate" was added to the init script, which signals
  rsyslogd to close all open files. This new action is used in the rsyslog
  logrotate configuration file.

sane-backends (1.0.22-1) unstable; urgency=low

sgml-base (1.26+nmu2) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with this release the SGML super catalog /etc/sgml/catalog will be
  replaced with a symbolic link to /var/lib/sgml-base/supercatalog. The latter
  file can be regenerated from the contents of the /etc/sgml directory including
  all files ending in .cat using the new update-catalog --update-super option.
  This call will be (dpkg) triggered by packages placing files in /etc/sgml. The
  transition to this way of handling the super catalog will loose user changes to
  /etc/sgml/catalog. Further overwriting of user changes will happen until all
  packages using dh_installcatalogs are built with a fixed version of debhelper.
  Sorry for the inconvenience.

sudo (1.8.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The sudo package is no longer configured using --with-secure-path.
  Instead, the provided sudoers file now contains a line declaring
  'Defaults secure_path=' with the same path content that was previously
  hard-coded in the binary.  A consequence of this change is that if you
  do not have such a definition in sudoers, the PATH searched for commands
  by sudo may be empty.

  Using explicit paths for each command you want to run with sudo will work
  well enough to allow the sudoers file to be updated with a suitable entry
  if one is not already present and you choose to not accept the updated
  version provided by the package.

sysv-rc (2.88dsf-28) unstable; urgency=low

  Dependency based boot ordering is now required.

  Most systems will already be using dependency based boot ordering.
  This includes all squeeze and later releases, unless you have taken
  deliberate action to disable it.  Installations upgraded from etch,
  lenny or earlier releases will have enabled dependency based booting
  when upgrading to squeeze and later releases.  However, it was
  previously possible to opt out of migrating to dependency based
  booting and retain static boot ordering.  This is no longer the case.

  If your system is still using static boot ordering, migrating to
  dependency based boot ordering will be performed when sysv-rc is
  configured.

  If you have custom init scripts, or old init scripts without LSB
  headers, please ensure that these have the correct dependency
  information in an LSB header so that they will be run at the correct
  point in the boot sequence.  By default, they tend to be ordered
  last, but before scripts requiring $all such as rc.local, but the
  ordering is not guaranteed.

telepathy-mission-control-5 (1:5.12.0-2) unstable; urgency=low

  This version of Mission Control will automatically migrate Windows
  Live Messenger accounts (also known as .NET Messenger, MSN Messenger etc.)
  from telepathy-butterfly to telepathy-haze when it starts up. To trigger
  this migration, ensure that telepathy-haze is installed, log out
  from your desktop session, and log back in.

  This has been done to support newer Telepathy interfaces required
  by Empathy 3.4, which are not present in telepathy-butterfly.

transmission (2.10-1) experimental; urgency=low
  
  As of 2.10 all binaries have been renamed to a more homogeneous 
  format, indicative of the UI type:
    - transmission      -> transmission-gtk 
    - transmissioncli   -> transmission-cli
    - qtr               -> transmission-qt

usb-modeswitch-data (20110227-1) unstable; urgency=low

  usb-modeswitch from its 1.1.7 version searches for its hardware switching
  database in a tarball (/usr/share/usb_modeswitch/configPack.tar.gz) first.
  Hence usb-modeswitch-data now only ships this tarball instead of the raw
  database files under /etc/usb_modeswitch.d .

  If you had modified some of these database files, they have been kept in
  place and will override the entries from the tarball, see the README.Debian.

vim (2:7.3.154+hg~74503f6ee649-1) unstable; urgency=low

  The vim-lesstif package has been removed in favor of the new vim-athena
  package.  The intent behind both packages is to provide a lighter-weight GUI
  package as well as one that allows using XFLD fonts.  The Athena toolkit,
  however,  has broader usage and reduces divergences with downstream
  distributions.

xdg-utils (1.0.2+cvs20100307-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * xdg-email now honors the $MAILER variable when deciding which mail
    user agent to use. Remember to wrap it in a terminal window if you're
    using a text-based mailer. For example:

    MAILER="xterm -e mutt"

    You can also list multiple mailers separated by colons, in which case
    xdg-email will try each one in order until one of them succeeds.

xserver-xorg-video-nouveau (1:0.0.16+git20120529+ace77b6-1) experimental; urgency=low

  Fermi cards (GeForce 4xx/5xx series) now require a recent Linux kernel
  for acceleration: either a Debian Kernel 3.2.0-3-$arch version 3.2.23-1
  and newer, or 3.4 and newer.  On older kernels they will only run
  unaccelerated.  Older NVidia cards are not affected.

xserver-xorg-video-nouveau (1:0.0.16+git20100518+4b8f1a0-1) experimental; urgency=low

  This version of xserver-xorg-video-nouveau is linked against a newer
  libdrm-nouveau which breaks the ABI and is not compatible with kernels
  <= 2.6.33.  You need to upgrade the kernel to 2.6.34-rc1 or newer.
