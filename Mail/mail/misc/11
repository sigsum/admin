lighttpd (1.4.31-4) unstable; urgency=high

  The default Debian configuration file for PHP invoked from FastCGI was
  vulnerable to local symlink attacks and race conditions when an attacker
  manages to control the PHP socket file (/tmp/php.socket up to 1.4.31-3)
  before the web server started. Possibly the web server could have been
  tricked to use a forged PHP.

  The problem lies in the configuration, thus this update will fix the problem
  only if you did not modify the file /etc/lighttpd/conf-available/15-fastcgi-php.conf
   If you did, dpkg will not overwrite your changes. Please make sure to set

        "socket" => "/var/run/lighttpd/php.socket"

  yourself in that case.
