cups (1.5.3-2.7) unstable; urgency=low

  In order to mitigate a privilege escalation from the lpadmin to root
  (CVE-2012-5519), the /etc/cups/cupsd.conf configuration file is split
  in two configuration files:

  * /etc/cups/cupsd.conf can be edited by members of the lpadmin group
    through the cups web interface;
  * /etc/cups/cups-files.conf can only be edited by root;

  Many sensitive configuration statements can now only be set in
  cups-files.conf. No statements have been moved automatically. Please
  check the respective manpages.
