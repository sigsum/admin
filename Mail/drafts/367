Hi,

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/createaccount.cgi says "User account
creation has been restricted."

Is it possible that this is related to which IP address I connect from?
I'm connecting over Tor and use one of ~1000 Tor exit relays to reach
your service. I can see how this could be a problem (spam).

Are there any alternative ways to create a bugzilla account?
