Trust? I trust these particular powers to be on the thinnest of ice with
a lot of peoples security on the line.

I trust them to collect too much information. Creating more risk by
collecting sensitive data and hoarding weaponised exploits is not how to
earn trust from those who care about security. Putting serious effort
into fixing broken systems and educate the open society about security
would be a start towards showing good will.

I trust them to suck it up to their U.S. colleagues, with a send/receive
balance so lopsided that it's totally out of the question to even
breathe about the fact that what NSA has been shown to do is way out of
line for a democratic society. This goes all the way to the top.

I trust FRA to keep pushing for more surveillance. TDV seems like a
dream come true to some but really more like a nightmare do me. Let's
bug our own networks and make it really secure? One would think that
someone at FRA of all places would be able to see the risk at that.

I trust them to keep downplaying the risks and overstate the gains of
extensive surveillance. Potential complaints can be disregarded because
we don't understand either of it, and neither can we learn more about it
because of the nature of the task.

Finally, the reason that the technical community is sceptical is because
we are used to look at things critically and ask for the source before
we see things as trustworthy. Knowing the field and understanding risk
is not making us feel any more comfortable.


No Johan, you don't have to -- and in fact must _not_ -- put your trust
into some _one_ in this world. You must put your trust into a system
that is run by a lot of people and doesn't get out of hands. A system
trusted by the people it's set out to protect. A system with checks and
balance. Something that reminds of democracy, the very thing you're
supposed to guard.
