Hi,

As discussed in Madrid, here's an instance of a wide open general
append-only log that should help you get started playing with logs if
you're interested in that.

It's running at

  https://open.gaol.ct.nordu.net:8080/

currently serving a certificate from a toy CA which root cert can be
found at

  https://www.ct.nordu.net/open-gaol.cacert.pem

The log key can be found at

  https://www.ct.nordu.net/open-gaol.logkey.pem

There should be a new tree head every 10 minutes.


The API is like RFC6962 with the following differences:

- ct/v1/add-chain is replaced by ct/v1/add-blob which input is 'blob'
  rather than 'chain'

- There's no ct/v1/add-pre-chain

Example of how to get an STH:

  curl -s --cacert open-gaol.cacert.pem https://open.gaol.ct.nordu.net:8080/ct/v1/get-sth

Submitting some data:

  printf '{"blob": ["my stuff"]}' | curl -s --cacert open-gaol.cacert.pem --data @- https://open.gaol.ct.nordu.net:8080/ct/v1/add-blob


This instance currently has a storage quorum of 1 and is susceptible to
sudden disappearance should the right (wrong) disks die. Another reason
for disappearance is if the log is abused for material that we can't
publish for legal reasons. Please be kind.

If you want to help out by running an additional frontend and storage
node for this log, please let me know and I will help you get going. The
source code and some very sparse documentation can be found by cloning
the following repos:

  https://git.nordu.net/catlfish.git
  https://git.nordu.net/plop.git
  https://git.nordu.net/catlfish-dockerfiles.git
  
This log instance is running the 'gaol' branch of catlfish.
