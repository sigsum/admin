Some clients have trust anchors that are locally added (e.g. by an
administrator or by the user themselves). A local trust anchor is
potentially privacy-sensitive since it may carry information about the
specific computer or user. If a certificate is covered by SCTs issued
by publicly trusted logs, but it chains to a privacy-sensitive local
trust anchor, the client SHOULD submit it as an 'x509\_chain'
consisting only of the leaf certificate.
