Hi Josva,

I've got a long list of Q&A now, a format I think will keep people awake
more than just rambling on. If possible, I would like to have them in a
presentation in such a way that I can click to get the next question,
then click again to get the answer and so forth. I will also provide
pictures to some, hopefully all, of them later tonight and
tomorrow. At all feasible?

Here are 15 questions with answers. I'm guessing I'll spend at least
half a minute on each of them. Do you think we're missing anything? My
gut feeling is that system design and other interesting topics would be
better handled in a smaller group, maybe in the dev group on Friday?

What's CT?
Certificate Transparency -- a public log, or bulletin board

A bulletin board for what?
SSL certificates for the web

What's a certificate?
A digital document tying a public key to a company name and a domain
name, sent from a web site to your browser

What's a public key?
A piece of data needed to encrypt the communication between your browser
and a web site

Why do we need a bulletin board for that?
Do detect illegitimate certificates

What's an illegitimate certificate?
A certificate made without the site owners explicit order

Why would that happen?
CA:s fail

Wait, what's a CA?
Certificate Authority -- manufacturing and signing certificates

Has this really happened?
Yes, Comodo and DigiNotar in 2011 being the most known examples

What will happen when my browser gets a cert not on the bulletin board?
There will be no green address bar in your browser

What if the bulletin board is lying too?
It will get caught by auditors and monitors and put out of business

Who's running this bulletin board?
Several, Google being one and ISOC hopefully another

Why is NORDUnet interested in this?
To save the world but also not letting Google be the only player

Is it hard?
A bit

Why?
Must never fail, needs high availability and has a somewhat high load
