OK.

I think that one of the missing pieces amongst those who are not heavily
engaged in the field is that the current system is horribly brittle and
not really trustworthy.

One more thing. "Criminal CAs" is not describing the problem very well,
especially not from a PR perspective. It's rather a problem of a) sloppy
CA:s and b) CA:s actually _following_ the laws they're operating
under. In the first category, sloppy, we find the ones issuing thousands
of test certs and those who can't keep up with the security threats on
the internet of today. In the second category we don't have much proof,
but the French National Cybersecurity Agency of France (ANSSI) case in
2013 [0][1], the Indian National Informatics Centre (NIC of India) case
in 2014 [2] and the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC)
case in 2015 [3][4] seem to be governments using their powers.

For operators, we could show the system design [0] and
