Hi,

Thanks for the information.

Note that I'm not asking for anything to change right now. I'm trying to
understand what's needed for operation of the service at this point in
time.

- What is 8080/tcp used for today? Your previous answer says that it's
  not being used now but that it might be in the future. This latest
  answer says that it's used for upgrading.

- Does Confluence need a TCP port for sending email or could it use some
  other mechanism?

Thanks,
Linus

| portal.nordu.net if you include the 8080 port as well. It would be
| good to be able to connect to the 8080 port from fw.eduix.fi as well
| though, as we use that when we're upgrading Confluence
| 
| - It isn't necessary to have the TCP port on cf-internal if you have a
| dedicated SMTP server that can be used for sending mail from
| Confluence but in this case we'd need to change the mail settings of
| Confluence before getting rid of it. I think it will work if bound to
| localhost but I'm not sure how to configure it so as someone else has
| actually set it up.

| Request description: Hi Eduix,
| 
| I'm looking at cf-internal and have a couple of questions. If this is
| not the right place for these questions, do you know whom to ask?
| 
| - It has Apache running on the http port (80/tcp). What is it used for?
|   From where does that service need to be reachable?
| 
| - What is SMTP (25/tcp) used for?
| 
| - There's a java process binding to ports 8005/tcp, 8009/tcp, 8080/tcp
|   and 9009/tcp. What are they used for?
| 
| Thanks,
| Linus
