I'm looking forward to reading that.  I've recently spent a considerable
amount of time thinking of and implementing host and network security
for maatuska (plus fighting all the rl and cyber daemons you could ever
dream of and then some).

My choice of operating system (FreeBSD) might make many of my specific
findings less valuable to the masses but the recently started analysis
of what kind of network traffic my directory authority attracts and
produces (!) is probably something all of the authority operators and
possibly a larger community will find useful and food for thought.
Before I cry wolf over that
