Hi Thomas,

Anything else in here that I can help with? You did get the difference
between paying for a port at an IX and paying a transit provider for a
full table?

WRT pond, I don't think it should matter much. Are you still suffering
the same error as in Paris?

| Hi again,
| 
| I had a very bad night's sleep so decided this morning to further my
| research about setting up an ISP. As most sites relating to Swedish
| ISP's, laws and hosts are in Swedish (surprise!) and my Swedish is still
| looking patchy beyond "Hur mår du?" and "Jag heter Thomas och jag är en
| tor operatör", I decided to look into setting up a UK ISP so I could get
| familiar with how it works overall rather than specifics.
| 
| Having looked all morning at this stuff (9 hours straight), some still
| makes no sense to me especially as it gets more technical, but I did
| notice what you said in the last email that Netnod was expensive. This
| is the biggest UK Internet Exchange Point fees for connecting:
| 
| https://www.linx.net/service/servicefees.html
| 
| 10GE for £675 a month or £8,100 a year, plus £1,200 annual membership
| fee is very good I think. Plus since I have existing contacts in the UK
| for legal and finance, I think that would be viable although I am still
| not sure how offering internet to the home would be, which really is
| quite high up my list of priorities since we lack "privacy preserving"
| ISPs here. Having said that I do believe I know somebody I could ask
| about getting into the "home internet" market so I will send him an
| email now for some basic information.
| 
| Accounting for this, what are your thoughts on starting a small ISP in
| the UK? The UK is not a great place to start because of GCHQ and that
| our laws allowing snooping - but in some ways that makes me want to
| start it even more as the first company to make a stand against their
| bullying and I am sure Privacy International and the Open Rights Group
| would jump right on board with me if they know our objective too. If
| they were interested, we could perhaps even ask Ross Anderson/Steven
| Murdoch for their opinion?
| 
| A further option of course is starting in two locations (Sweden and the
| UK) at once, but that may be me getting a little ahead of myself.
| 
| Also, assuming we had a 10GE connection, does peering with a datacenter
| mean we effectively have free bandwidth up to 10GE (minus peering
| allocations) on our own servers? Looking at my hosting costs for running
| Tor, it would be cheaper for me to get a 10GE line, and then use that
| 10GE line just to run my servers on co-location. With my current host,
| the 8Gbps I currently have costs me 3200 Euro/month, plus another 2000
| Euro/month for all the server rentals. If I got a 10GE line and use
| colocation, that can be reduced to just 1400 Euro/month after the
| hardware has been purchase so it will be cheaper in the long-term.
| 
| Anyway sorry for typing a lot (and sorry if it makes no sense) here, a
| lot of new ideas I had that I wanted to write down before I forget them
| because I think your idea of starting an ISP is brilliant. If anything
| above makes no sense, just let me know and I will retype it when I've
| had a bit more sleep.
| 
| Regards,
| Tom
| 
| P.S Having a second shot at setting up Pond this afternoon. What OS
| would Pond work best on as my Linux Mint seems to break a lot of
| programs I think?
