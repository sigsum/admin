Hi Michiel, Christian,

Michiel, please virtually meet Christian from Teknikbyr√•n. Christian and
TB have helped DFRI enormously with transport in Stockholm.

Christian, please meet Michiel from Atrato, who's helped us with servers
in Bromma. We've unfortunately not yet been able to put them to much use
due to lack of connectivity to Bromma.


I hear you're coming to Stockholm next week, Michiel. What about a quick
visit at TC Bromma together and see if we can find those filters we've
been discussing on and off? I'm available mostly all days.

Best regards,
Linus
