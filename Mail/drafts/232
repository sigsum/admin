Subject: Switching directory signing key to RSA2048
From: Linus Nordberg <linus@nordberg.se>

Hi directory authority operators,

https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/ticket/10324 describes why we
should stop signing status documents with RSA1024 and suggests switching
to RSA2048.

Unless someone stop me I'm going to start signing with a 2048 bit key in
about two days (Wed Dec 11 12:00 UTC). If all goes well, I'm going to
ask you to do the same at some point.
