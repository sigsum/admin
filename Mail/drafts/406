Hi,

Anyone who's got a recommendation for where to stay the night? Hotel
near venue preferred.

Thanks in advance,
Linus

| Dear all,
| 
| As we are with around 20 people next week at the kick-off of JRA3,
| it’s quite a challenge to find a restaurant which can accommodate us
| and suits everybody’s taste ;-) So won’t organise a joint dinner.
| 
| As an alternative we do have a list of restaurant suggestions: See the link below for the google map with the restaurants. Click on the letters for more information. 
| 
| When you arrive in Utrecht, please keep in mind SURFnet has moved as
| of January 1st. We are still in the shopping mall (Hoog Catharine),
| but at another office building (Hoog Overborch).  See also the google
| map, for our new office.

| See you next week!
