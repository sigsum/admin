Hi,

We need the DFRI part of the twin machine in Åkers to be power cycled.

There's an issue with soft reboot where it hangs at some stage (likely
on its way down). We managed to get out of that situation yesterday
night using the IPMI/ILO interface. I've now managed to lock us out of
the IPMI interface so that's not an option.

The next time any of you are nearby, please kick the machine? Thanks!
