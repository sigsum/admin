| 
| This is some voluminous, off-topic flooding and harassment on the
| ba.broadcast Usenet newsgroup.  It is being reported to abuse reporting
| mailboxes based on the contents of the NNTP-Posting-Host: and
| X-Complaints-To: headers in the posted article quoted below, and lookup
| of the originating IP address in the NNTP-Posting-Host: header via WHOIS
| and the Network Abuse Clearinghouse.  They are sometimes also
| crossposted to unrelated newsgroups such as rec.arts.tv,
| soc.culture.new-zealand, and several other newsgroups in the nz.*
| hierarchy.  It is disruptive, and completely off-topic, as well as
| causing disruptive, cascaded flame wars among those unrelated
| newsgroups.
| 
| Note to TOR Exit Node maintainers:
| 
| This article is from Google Groups, a third-party news posting site,
| providing both a web-interface newsreader and a http-to-nntp posting
| gateway, via http (80 port) and/or https (443 port).  I have received
| replies from other TOR exit server maintainers that they will
| temporarily block connectivity to Google Groups' range of IP addresses,
| as this kind of repetitive flooding to deny use of a newsgroup is not
| free speech, and not what the TOR project was intended to be used for.
| The IP addresses for Google Groups are as follows:
| 
| groups.google.com	canonical name = groups.l.google.com.
| Name:	groups.l.google.com
| Address: 74.125.142.102
| Name:	groups.l.google.com
| Address: 74.125.142.113
| Name:	groups.l.google.com
| Address: 74.125.142.138
| Name:	groups.l.google.com
| Address: 74.125.142.139
| Name:	groups.l.google.com
| Address: 74.125.142.100
| Name:	groups.l.google.com
| Address: 74.125.142.101
| 
| Name:	googlegroups.com

| Address: 74.125.142.147
| 
| In response to requests from other TOR Exit Server maintainers, the
| following are suggested rejection rules in torrc format.  Please place
| the following lines before any "ExitPolicy accept {range}:{ports}"
| entries in your torrc file:
| 
|   # Refuse direct connect to Google Groups inject servers.
|   #
|   # Usenet works fine elsewhere for anon access, while Google refuses
|   # abuse reports and has no effective abuse prevention capability,
|   # leading to Google Groups being an abuse magnet with at best
|   # questionable civil liberties value.
|   #
|   ExitPolicy reject 74.125.142.99/32:*, reject 74.125.142.100/32:*, reject 74.125.142.101/32:*, reject 74.125.142.102/32:*, reject 74.125.142.103/32:*, reject 74.125.142.104/32:*, reject 74.125.142.105/32:*, reject 74.125.142.106/32:*, reject 74.125.142.113/32:*, reject 74.125.142.138/32:*, reject 74.125.142.139/32:*, reject 74.125.142.147/32:*
| 
| Note that the above configuration blocks * (all) ports at those IP
| addresses, instead of just the minimal 80 and 443.
| 
| Google Groups would otherwise have to implement blocking of your exit
| nodes to stop this flooder.  The security practices of sites under my
| control are fine, including blocking of all TOR exit servers.  I do not
| have control over what Google Groups does, including banning accounts or
| blocking connections, or even configuring connections from TOR exit
| servers as read-only without posting privileges, which appears to be a
| best-practice at other public News Service Providers (NSP's).  Google
| Groups has been included as a recipient of this abuse complaint.
| 
| Newsreader kill files are of limited usefulness against a determined,
| nym-shifting, and thread-jacking flooder.  They also do not address
| first impressions for new users of a newsgroup.  The end state may be
| one where a "perfect" kill file may just wind up deleting 100% of the
| articles in a newsgroup because everyone sane has long since been run
| off.  Advice to "ignore the trolls" may also not be of much help once
| the trolls have turned on each other, as has now happened.
| 
| The article quoted below is one of thousands over the past year.  A good

| The charter of ba.broadcast is as follows:

|   "This group is here for discussions, comments and program reminders

| The charter does not include sexual innuendo and libel, abusive threats,

|   Ok, here it is, a true story:
|     
|   Thanksgiving 1996....a tall white guy wearing a fedora
|   comes lurching into a non-descript porn shop at 412 Broadway
|   in San Francisco. He mumbles a barely discernible greeting
|   to the clerk on duty, and begins to examine the x-rated
|   movies for dale.  The tall man has trouble breathing,
|   and wobbles in his stance. He is "three sheets to the
|   wind." In his hasty inebriated excitement,
|   he keeps dropping the VHS boxes, as he'e holding too many
|   of them, and his coordination is obviously impaired. Finally,
|   after the third time he drops a stack of 4-hour anal
|   compilations, he is asked by the clerk to leave. He
|   mumbles something like "You're very rude!" to the clerk,
|   who retorts, "Yeah?   You're very drunk!"
|     
|   The clerk wonders if the man ia a broadcaster, as he
|   had a very distinctive voice...
|     
|   Some time later, the drunken man's picture is published
|   on the front page of the Examiner during a pro-Prop 209
|   rally...and the drunk who was kicked out
|   the store turns out to be...Michael "Savage"!!!
|     
|   And folks, the story IS true. I know. I was that clerk!!
|     
|   I'm sure he'll deny this, and post some childish retort...
|   I doubt if he remembers the incident, as incapacitated as
|   he was.
|     
|   Maybe people should call up "Savage Nation", and see if he
|   wants to discuss his morals, since he's seemed to be so
|   concerned with those of our president, and the country. I'm sure
|   his faithful lapdog and #1 hyperventilating fanboy
|   "Ras" will be quick to defend the honor of his radio idol, no??
|   Come on, boys, don't disappoint me...
|     
|   BTW, I could care less that he was in my porn store...my beef
|   is that the drunken cheap prick didn't buy anything, and I
|   had to put back all those anal comp boxes he dropped...

|   Reading Enoch's websites and postings
|   confirm:
|     
|   Father of lies, KFJC 89.7 FM "Devil's Radio"
|   DEVIL Beaner Spic Jose' Scott Also
|   of KZSU 90.1 FM:
|     
|   1. Worked on an actual Jack Ruby
|   (1963 Jew Coup)
|   owned property / pornography shop
|   in San Francisco.  Broadway Street.
|   Shall I get the details Jose?
|   MK-ULTRA DRUG DEALER OUTLAW
|   @ Jack Ruby's Pornography Shop!
|   KZSU FM - Now Hoover Institute MK-ULTRA.
|     
|   2. Jose Scott posting filthy lies against
|   radio show host Michael Savage,
|   claiming that he came
|   into the store, looked at the "anal
|   compilations", and was seen dropping them.
|   Claimed Michael Savage looked drunk.
|   Notice Jose' Scott's total pre-occupation
|   in regards to raping people's asses.
|   THE TOTAL DEPRAVITY AND FILTH.
|     
|   3. The webpage of lies that Jose' Scott is
|   passing around happens to be created by
|   an admitted and proven cabal conspiracy
|   of Luciferians.  Go to Enoch's websites:
|   http://www.exorcist.org.nz/citizen_cohn_luciferian_higdon_byrd.html
|   Confirmed satanist conspiracy.
|   Enoch is hated because he exposes the
|   luciferian conspiracy which is totally
|   behind the child-trafficking, snuff films,
|   pornographic (Jack Ruby Jose Scott)
|   pedophile child trafficking network hidden
|   by the devil police underworld.
|     
|   And that lucifer JEW created web-page about

|   SANDUSKY SYLED ALCOHOLISM:
|     
|   Under-Age Alcohol Provided, Offered,
|   REGULARILY
|   By Foothill's KFJC FM Faculty Advisor Moderator:
|     
|   Robert Edward Pelzel,
|   where allegations against him in regards to mail fraud at KFJC
|   are documented, through the accusations by ex-station member Anthony
|   Ladd, myself and others.  Robert Edward Pelzel sees nothing wrong
|   with
|   the pronounced satanism at KFJC (where he also helps at KALX FM in
|   Berkeley) and also provides alcohol to minors at the Boardwalk Bar
|   in Los Altos.  The Boardwalk is the location of the weekly Wed. after
|   station meeting.  Robert Edward Pelzel is an alcoholic (is seen
|   outdrinking anyone there), and thus provides pitchers of beer to
|   those who come down.  There is no supervision amongst his purchases
|   - while acting as a Foothill College Faculty Advisor.  KFJC is a
|   drug promoting culture and Robert Edward Pelzel sees nothing wrong
|   with what is going down there.  Jose' Scott even admitted publicly
|   that he took L.S.D. at least twice on the airwaves at KFJC 89.7 FM.
|   Jose' called himself:  Uncle Sydney.  Only he knows why.
