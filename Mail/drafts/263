Sure.

I just re-read 4.2. I am the one missing something. Please ignore this.

I'm actually running my authority without any other hat than my Linus
hat. :)

Anyway, the legal entity called Tor Project makes a point of not running
any relays but maybe you mean the community Tor Project and that's what
the reader should understand. Given that there are directory operators
not part of the "commit code, hang out on IRC and at conferences
community" I think that's slightly misleading too.
