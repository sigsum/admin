Hi Ralf,

Since you've been working on fixing the Proxy-State issue, can I ask you
to try out branch proxy-state in the public repo [1] and see if it does
what the standard says we should do?

If possible, please do _not_ use --enable-experimental-dyndisc for these
tests. I have reason to believe that you might be happy without them,
now that Fabian Mauchles patches are in.

I'm planning on releasing 1.6.3 before the end of the week. If this
works in your setup, I feel much more confident about letting other
people test it.

Thanks!
