Hi Dijana!

Thanks for links and good info. I'll start asking people here about
possible collaboration with SARNET to see if I can find any overlapping
interests.

Here's the parrot paper:
http://freehaven.net/anonbib/#oakland2013-parrot

Here's the paper mostly confirming the parrot paper:
http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~liangw/pub/ccsfp653-wangA.pdf

You should probably look at other papers at freehaven.net. Tom Shrimpton
seems to be involved in lots of the obfuscation stuff.

| Hi!
| 
| Here is a link to conference (symposium) I've mentioned earlier today
| Infoteh - http://www.infoteh.rs.ba/indexe.php. It is organized by
| Faculty of Electrical Engineering East Sarajevo, and one of the
| co-organizers is my home faculty Faculty of Electrical Engineering,
| University of Banja Luka. You can write to the main organizer, and I will
| try to get some info about it from the people from my faculty, also.
| 
| As I can see, there is no English version of the Web site of SARNET 
| (Serbs Academic and Research Network) http://www.akademska.net/, but you
| can contact them on info@jusarnet.net. SARNET is a part of AMRES (Academic
| Network of Serbia), so you can also write to them that you are interested
| to give a talk on Tor maybe both in Belgrade and Banja Luka. Here is their
| Web site: https://www.amres.ac.rs/index.php?lang=en. I will also try to
| get some additional info on SARNET from one of my colleagues who is
| working there.
| 
| It was nice meeting you again and I will try to keep you up-to-date with
| the CryptoCloak.
