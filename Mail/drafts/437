Hi,

You are in one way or the other associated with one of the organisations
listed below, organisations I think might be interested in doing a joint
call for money from the European Commission.

DFRI and SUNET are looking for participants in an H2020 call for
proposals with the thrilling title "Collective Awareness Platforms for
Sustainability and Social Innovation" [0]. While I'm not sure that this
is the only (or even best) call to go for, I'd like to use this as a
concrete example for polling you all about your interest in
participating in a) writing a proposal and b) taking part in the actual
work, should we land the dough.

[0] http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/portal/desktop/en/opportunities/h2020/topics/5070-ict-11-2017.html

My idea is that those of you interested in a) would put a one paragraph
blurb per idea you think of when you read that call (over and over) in a
response to this message within a week. On Friday in a week from now
(Dec 4 at 17:00 UTC) we meet over tee and beer -- as physical as we can
make it -- and see who's into working on a proposal and what stuff
should be in it. I'll coordinate some kind of remote participation
functionality to tie the groups together
