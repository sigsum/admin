Hi,

I experience problem with security/tor-devel when BUFFEREVENTS is on
which I think has to do with libevent, now at 2.0.13 in ports.  I also
think that it's fixed in later versions of libevent.

libevent-2.0.16-stable was released yesterday.  Are you the right person
to ask for libevent-2.0.16 in ports?

Thanks,
Linus
