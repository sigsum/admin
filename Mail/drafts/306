| hey linus,
| 
| sorry, i was hoping the others would react to our mail exchange, but i think everyone is a little overwhelmed with the forum organization! :)
| thanks for the background info on the swedish agencies. at this point, any sort of mapping of the swedish landscape is very helpful.
| 
| as to the forum, amelia andersdotter is coming, so there will be
| someone from sweden there, it would be better if one of you guys were
| there and would do an unconference session to organize with the local
| activists. this would also be a great opportunity to raise awareness
| of the issue. so, please let me and melih know if one of you is coming
| so that we can organize accordingly.
| cheers,
| s.
