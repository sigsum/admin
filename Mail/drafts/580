Hi Emily,

We're trying to get the CT Gossip draft [1] to working group last call
(wglc) in the TRANS working group of the IETF but lack knowledge about
what implementations there might be.

[1] https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-trans-gossip/

I am curious if  Google has anything cooking in Chrome that might make
us wiser wrt to this, if you can share. Last time we spoke, over email,
