Hi!

So regarding barbecue here or there, my Friday is gone since long.  So
is my Saturday.  My Sunday is semi-open.  What do you think about
$subject?

Robban & Cissi will be there, hopefully some other interesting and nice
people.  Computers _may_ be problematic (unless we bring power somehow)
but we can socialise, right?

The location is Årsta-fältet.  The food is picnic food.

Waddayasay?
