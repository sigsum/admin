| Dear Linus,
| 
| I don't know if you'll remember, we met in July in Paris at the Mozilla
| Foundation during the Tor summer meeting -- I was writing an article for
| Slate.fr. Now I work for Libération, a French daily newspaper, and I
| suggested to write a story about Tor "against the clichés", with a
| historical and political perspective. They were quite enthusiastic :)
| 
| This is why I'm writing to you. Would you be OK for an interview about
| the current state of the project and its ongoing developments? Either by
| mail or on Jabber or w/ any VoIP that you fancy. Just tell me what you
| prefer.

Hi Amaelle!
