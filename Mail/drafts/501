Dear Dr Asghari and Dr Greenstadt,

On behalf of DFRI, I hereby confirm our plans to collaborate with the
MAPPED ("Mining and Probing the Privacy Ecosystem Data") project. In
particular, this includes contributing expertise to the project setup,
disseminating the projects call for volunteers through our network, and
participating in the final dialogue workshops.

DFRI is a Swedish non-profit and non-party organisation working for
digital rights, and a member of the European Digital Rights Group
(EDRi).

We are enthusiastic about the project and look forward to the 
collaboration.

Sincerely,

xxxxx
