Hi Remco,

As discussed in Vienna recently.

# Here's an overview of catlfish. Text and a nice picture.

--8<---------------cut here---------------start------------->8---
Catlfish is an implementation of a Certificate Transparency log that is
designed to work well in a multi-organization Internet-wide deployment
environment.

The system is divided into frontend, storage, merge, and signing nodes.
Frontend nodes provide the public HTTPS service for submission and
queries. Submitted certificate chains are validated and sent to all
storage nodes. When a configured quorum of the storage nodes report that
they have stored the data on disk, a signature is requested from a
signing node and a Signed Certificate Timestamp (SCT) is returned to the
submitter.

The primary merge node periodically collects all new log entries from
the storage nodes, orders them, builds a new tree, signs the root hash
and distributes the new entries and the signed root hash to the frontend
nodes.

# Here's my rough view on what will happen 2016-05 -- 2017--04.

Continue develop catlfish (and plop) in order to
- reach a 1.0 release
- implement CT v2 (ie rfc6962bis)
- improve support for building other transparency systems (like Binary
  Transparency, DNSSEC Transparency and Tor Consensus Transparency)
- produce good user guides and system documentation
- improve test coverage
- remove burdens on deployment and operation of a log

Work on CT gossip standardisation within the IETF, including
- getting the draft to working group last call
- implementing proof-of-concept code for the whole shebang -- browser,
  web server, monitor and auditor
- contribute to the TRANS wg work with rfc6962-bis, the threat
  analysis draft and if possible also the non-wg drafts

Advocate for both CT and transparency systems in general by giving
talks, presenting at conferences, arrange training for developers and
operational staff.
