Hi,

radsecproxy-1.6.7 has been released. We think it's the best radsecproxy
release ever. Here's what the ChangeLog has to say about this release:

	Enhancements (security):
	- Negotiate TLS1.1, TLS1.2 and DTLS1.2 when possible, client and
	server side. Fixes RADSECPROXY-62.

	Enhancements:
	- Build HTML documentation properly.

Pick it up from https://software.nordu.net/radsecproxy/ .

Thanks to those of you who've helped testing this release!
