| Hi
| Ref. my below mail of last year I have noted that some profiles have been
| updated which is good, but unfortunately not all of them.
| 
| In 2012 you have booked SAS /Star Alliance flights between you worth a
| total sum of  DKK 270,000. We get an average TPC discount of approx 4 % per
| trip if booked correctly, so in rough terms we have missed savings of more
| than DKK 10,000 because of the missing TPC numbers in the profiles.  And
| this is excluding flights made in 2013. Therefore please spend a couple of
| minutes updating you profiles. If you encounter any problems, please do not
| hesitate to contact me.
| 
| Thank you for your cooperation.

| Subject:  TPC numbers and profiles
| 
| Dear all
|  In connection with the upcoming change of credit cards we will  link your
| TPC numbers to the new credit cards to make sure that we continue to get the
| right discounts in the SAS corporate booking system. We will do that
| centrally noting your TPC numbers from your profiles in the system, so you
| will not have to worry about it. The only thing is that right now the TPC
| numbers seem to be missing from your profiles in the corporate booking
| system.  Please check your profile and make sure it is updated so we can
| benefit from the discounted prices this system provides us with.
| 
| You will find  your TPC number at the back of your credit card, and in your
| profile you enter the number under the menu item "Other cards", ref. the
| screen dumps below.
| If you need assistance,  please do not hesitate to contact me.
| 
| with best regards
| SMI
