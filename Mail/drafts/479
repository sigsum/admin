Hi,

is there a repository with source code somewhere?
Can't seem to find any pointers at https://cat.eduroam.org/ .

Using "downloading the installer" and picking an institution at random
gives me a shell script. Is there more code than this?

A first question regarding that shell script would be "Are you using any
bash-specific features or would /bin/sh work?"
