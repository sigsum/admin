Network trouble can result from DoS mitigation at or near the
directory authorities.

I've just recently realised how much crap maatuska receives.  A
thousand dir port connections from a single address for example.

I've now started limiting the number of TCP connections and TCP
establishment rate from a single address.  The numbers are hard to get
right, we don't want to hurt clients behind a NAT f.ex.  Right now,
maatuska allows 600 new connections per minute from a single address
and a maximum of 100 simultaneous connections.  Some 50-100 addresses
get caught in that filter per day.

I suspect that most if not all of the dirauths sit behind equipment
doing something similar to this.  Ask your provider.  And please ask
them how they treat the logs from that equipment.
