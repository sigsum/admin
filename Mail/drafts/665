Hi Al,

How are things? Hope they're well.

I'm currently fighting a headache with its origin in trying to figure
out how badly the suggested chaining of STH's [0] are for a secure
distributed CT log. My initial conclusion is that, because we'd end up
with two append only data structures, which are not independent of each
other, this is a complicating enough change that I should scream stop
and argue why. Curious to hear if you've thought about it and concluded
it's easy enough to let it pass or perhaps already solved it?
