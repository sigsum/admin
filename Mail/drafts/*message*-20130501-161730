Hi Nick,

Logs from running make check on two fbsd machines attached.

I haven't looked into any of the tests. Please let me know which of
these are not obvious failures and I'll debug it some and give you more
input.

(Today is not a computer day for me though so please don't hold off any
release just because of this.)

And oh, the fbsd-8 make check is taking forever to finish due to dns
weirdnesses we've discussed before. Its output has been cut.
