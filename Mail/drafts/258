3.  Reported Instances of Large-Scale Attacks lists US and UK
intelligence services. While they indeed seem superior, should more
reported attackers be mentioned?

If so, it could mention Swedish intelligence services FRA, based on
[REUTERS-SE] and documents published by Swedish state television
[SVT-UG].

It could perhaps mention France too, based on [GUARDIAN-FR]. People with
more local knowledge might be able to verify if there's any substance to
the claim. Should it mention German, Spanish and Dutch intelligence
services too, based on [GUARDIAN-EU-ALLIES]?
