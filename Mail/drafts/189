Hi,

While verifying tool chains, other user land components and kernels
would be a Good Thing indeed, I'm not sure that's within reach.

I'd like to point at something shockingly new -- reproducible, or
deterministic, builds for larger end user software packages [0]. The
Bitcoin people started it and Tor picked it up and wrote about it
[1][2]. I've seen Debian and RedHat pick it up [3][4] since.

It's not protecting against back doored tool chains, ofc, but rather an
operational issue with distributing binaries.

That said, if we find funding for verifying _some_ tool chains, great.
