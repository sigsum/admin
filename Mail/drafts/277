That is indeed true.

If all the traffic (or meta data) the campus IT people ever had recorded
from his particular laptop for the last couple of years had been Tor
traffic, I wonder how much it'd mattered though. As usual, starting to
anonymise your traffic the second you want to be anonymous usually
doesn't work out so well.

Yes. Public relays are public. That's how clients can chose their three
hops without risk of being steered towards certain relays attacking them.

Bridges, on the other hand, are not. And private bridges are not even
semi-public. You'd need DPI or active probing to figure out they're Tor
relays. Using PT's, even that might fail. But I'm repeating myself.
