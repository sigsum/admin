Hi epfsugers,

A quick follow-up on a complaint I sent to the commission around the
time of my previous thread on this subject [1].

After a month, I got a message telling me that my inquiry had been
forwarded to "the competent Commission service". That was a month ago.
The time line can be found at [2].

Ideas on how to proceed?

Thanks,
Linus
