| Symantec, GlobalSign, Trend Micro and Entrust have a couple of concerns 
| about the deployment of CT.
| 
| 1) We have all built in the ability to easily add new log servers as they 
| come on board, but we're getting very close to deploying our final CT code 
| within the next month, and we want to test and validate our code with three 
| distinct log servers before we go live. At this point, we have no practical 
| way to do that. In our earlier testing, we included two SCTs from the same 
| log server, and used our own non-production quality test log server, and 
| manually configured Chrome to trust it. But we would all breathe easier if 
| we could test against three officially trusted log servers.
| 
| We would like to ask Google to commit to a date when (at least) a third log 
| server will be announced, or else relax the 3-SCT rule for 15-27 month 
| certs, sooner the better. If the 3-SCT rule is relaxed, we need to code in 
| that change and test it. 
| 
| 2) We have to open up outbound access through our firewall to Googleâ€™s log 
| servers, and our IT folks have a policy whereby outbound access from hosts 
| involved in the certificate issuance process is allowed for external 
| services only on known IP addresses. Can Google publish the IP addresses or 
| net block range of their log servers for this purpose?

The GEANT project together with ISOC is working on a plan for
establishing a production CT log. They hope to be able to announce their
timetable soon.
