Hi dear Tor assistants!

DFRI is ordering a bunch of Rasperry Pi:s for installing Tor on them
(configured as a relay) and handing them out to members. We've been
discussing slapping a Tor sticker on them or put them in 3D-printed
cases with the Tor logo.

Would either of these options be problematic from a trademark
perspective?

From reading the trademark FAQ [0] it seems like the sticker idea
wouldn't be a problem but what about the 3D-printed case? It will not
