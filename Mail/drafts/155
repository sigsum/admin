| I suspect that with enough TOR traffic scrambled hard enough that you can't decrypt a particular one without decrypting a significant portion of the connections, 1024-bit DHE is plenty strong enough. Sure, upgrading to 2048-bit makes it harder to crack, but the TOR network is already way too slow.

While Tor relays indeed do spend some CPU on TLS (roughly 1/3, with
cell encryption and key FIXME) I'm not sure that the TLS handshaking
is costly enough to worry about [0] via [1] via [2].
