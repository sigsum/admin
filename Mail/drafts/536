Hi Anders and Kolbjørn,

NORDUnet is ready to take over the radsecproxy mailing list whenever you
are.

I think the following steps make sense. Let me know if you have any
suggested changes or additions to this.

0. You disable subscriptions to radsecproxy@uninett.no and put up a sign
on the web and possibly in any response messages from your list manager
that the list has moved to https://lists.nordu.net/admin/radsecproxy/ .

1. I change the information on
https://software.nordu.net/radsecproxy/contact/ to point at
https://lists.nordu.net/admin/radsecproxy/ .

2. You send me the list of subscribers of radsecproxy@uninett.no,
including full names where appropriate.

3. I subscribe them all to radsecproxy@lists.nordu.net without sending
out a notification.

4. You set up forwarding of email sent to radsecproxy@uninett.no to go
to radsecproxy@lists.nordu.net.

5. I post a message about upcoming changes to radsecproxy@uninett.no to
make sure that the forwarding works.

6. You send me the mailing list archives and I try to make them available.

7. I post information to the list saying that the change have been done.

8. I tell you that the archives have been succesfully imported and you
put up information at
https://sympa.uninett.no/lists/uninett.no/arc/radsecproxy/ that points
to http://lists.nordu.net/pipermail/radsecproxy/ but keep your archives
so that old links keep working. If we can find out how to set up an HTTP
redirect for each message in your archive, let's do that and you can
remove your archives.

What do you think?
