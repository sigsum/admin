Hi Nick,

A couple of sentences got cut off in that interesting post of yours.

|    * Dubious stuff in NIST standards. Everybody's pointing at that
| Dual_EC RNG, but other stuff will be getting a lot of cryptographer
| scrutiny.  What isn't broken may often be found to be deliberately

Here's one.

|    * The commercial CA world is possibly a house of cards.
|    * Operating system RNGs are a black hole of stupidity. On the one
| hand, entropy collection really ought to be an OS function.  On the
| other hand,

Here's another.

| Also, RSA1024 and DH1024 are *not* what folks ought to be using
| nowadays.  (See that article where a guy who knows how to use   So

And here.
