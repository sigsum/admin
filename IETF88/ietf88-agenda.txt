0800-1700  IETF Registration - Balmoral
0900-1130  Technical Plenary - Regency A/B/C/D

   Live video streaming of the Technical Plenary will be available at http://www.ietf.org/live/. 
   
   The live text transcription will be at http://www.ietf.org/live/text.html. 
   
   
   1.  IAB Chair Report
   2.  IRTF Chair Report
   3.  RSE and RSOC Chair Report
   4.  Technical Topic: Internet Hardening
   
       New reports of large-scale Internet traffic monitoring appear almost
       every day.  We were all aware that targeted interception was taking
       place, but the scale and scope in the recent reports is surprising.
       Such scale was not envisaged during the design of many Internet
       protocols; the threat is quite different than expected.  Now, the
       Internet community must consider the consequences.
   
       While details of these attack techniques remain largely unknown, we
       can talk about possible ways to harden the Internet in light of
       pervasive Internet monitoring.  We can take a closer look at our
       protocols and the security properties that they provide.
   
       A panel will summarize recent discussions and suggest potential IETF
       actions to make large-scale monitoring more difficult.
   
       a.  Introduction (Bruce Schneier)
   
           What we know and what we do not know.
   
       b.  Earlier IETF Debates (Brian Carpenter)
   
           The IETF has several cornerstone documents about Internet
           security and privacy, including RFCs 1984, 3365, 2804, and 6973.
   
       c.  Potential IETF Activities (Stephen Farrell)
   
           Summary of the discussion on the perpass mailing list.
