The JOSE WG met on Thursday 7 November 2013 at 0900 PST.

The JOSE WG has been focused entirely on resolving issues in the issue
tracker for the four core specification (JWA, JWS, JWE, JWK). Previous
to this IETF, there have been four virtual interim meetings and a
series of meetings between the editor and the wg co-chairs to address
open issues. This has resulted in most of the remaining open issues
having proposed resolutions that are either awaiting implementation or
verification. Today's meeting focused on identifying resolutions for
all the remaining open issues. The editor plans two updates between
now and the end of the year that will close all remaining open
issues. A virtual interim is tentatively planned for 13 January to
review the document set and prepare for WGLC. In addition, a plan for
the cook book document was discussed and an initial draft of that
document is expected in January as well.

TLS met on Tuesday Afternoon.  The raw public key draft has completed
IETF last call.  The cached info draft will be reviewed by the DICE
working group.  The ALPN draft is under discussion due to issues with
some servers dropping clientHellos of particular sizes.  TLS-PWD will
be heading to working group last call.  The room voiced support for
adopting the TLS BCP draft, but a new revision will be necessary
before working group adoption.  We discussed several approaches to
migrate to encrypt then mac for CBC mode, more discussion on the list
is necessary to determine the approach.  We had a presentation on
ChaCha20 based cipher suites and there was general support for it in
the room.  We discussed different protocol flows to reduce the round
trips for the TLS 1.3 handshake and to initia
 te encryption earlier in the TLS 1.3 handshake.

The HTTP-Auth working group will meet Friday morning at 9:00 AM

The plan is to discuss the HOBA and Rest-Auth documents, as well as
commonalities among all proposals.

We will also report of the interim meeting that dealt with
MutualAuth. Other documents are progressing, but we try to discuss
only a few per meeting, so as to have a more useful discussion.

Dice met for the first time as a WG on Monday afternoon.  The DTLS
profile draft was presented and a call for Volunteers for
authors/Editor was made as the previous authors were unable to
continue the work.  Klaus Hartke presented the dice practical issues
draft as input to the profile draft.  The Multicast draft was
presented, a number of comments were discussed including the limited
scope of using DTLS for multicast, crypto agility for regional plug
ins, detecting replay attacks.  Given updates to the current draft, a
hum was taken by the WG to progress this draft to WG status.  This
decision will be confirmed on the WG list.
