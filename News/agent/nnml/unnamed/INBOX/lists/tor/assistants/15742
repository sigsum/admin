(The short answer: Disabling JavaScript might make you more secure,
but it will make you less anonymous.)

Torbutton made JavaScript tolerably safe for users' anonymity.  The
Tor Browser Bundle takes further steps to keep JavaScript from harming
your anonymity.

The SSL Observatory add-on should not send information about your
computer -- it is meant to only send the SSL 'certificates' sent by
the websites which you connect to while browsing.  If that popup's
text confused you, please file a bug report against 'HTTPS Everywhere'
at https://trac.torproject.org/ ; you won't be the only person
confused by it.

The SSL Observatory feature is likely to improve its users' security
against eavesdropping by certain attackers.  I do not know whether the
SSL Observatory feature can be enabled while browsing through Tor, and
I do not know what effects the SSL Observatory would have on its
users' anonymity if it can be enabled in TBB.

I personally click "No".

That popup needs to be removed from the next TBB release.
