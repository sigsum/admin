The same thing will happen with links to The Pirate Bay. You cannot talk
about them on Facebook.

Imagine 30 years ago, when we were on the phone and discussed something,
if a voice had popped in and said "you have mentioned an inappropriate
subject. Please refrain from inappropriate communications." We would
have been horrified. It would have been seen as so dystopic, that if it
had been written in a novel of fiction, it would have been discarded as
just unrealistic.

Well, we're there.

Cheers,
Rick
