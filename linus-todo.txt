   . investigate libevent dns test failures on freebsd
     o why are jails different from non jails?
       o there's no i/f with 127.0.0.1 -- how does that affect things?

   . move all services from banksy to mm -- ports don't seem to work well!
     * lnspam -- email filtering, clamav + spamd; set up ssh tunnel
       to new jail (port 783) on lnmail and change '-d lnspam' to '-d
       localhost' in /usr/local/src/mail-filter.sh; same for
       spam-edu.sh
     * web -- apache-2.2.22_5 is vulnerable, php5-5.3.8 too; imp
       connects to 'lnmail' over SSL
       (/usr/local/www/horde/ipm/config/servers.php) so change to
       'imap.adb-centralen.se'; imp uses local postfix to send mail
       ('relayhost' in postfix/main.cf); connects to mysql at lnspam
     . krb
       o install another kdc
       - merge users from old kdc to new

   - mm: move /usr/home/bup to its own dataset -- lets us back up /usr/home
     maybe /usr/local/etc/ too?
