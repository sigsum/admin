#+TITLE: Ephemeral keying for ABFAB
#+AUTHOR: Linus Nordberg, NORDUnet
#+EMAIL: linus@nordu.net

* Goals for today
- Lure you to think about ephemeral keys
- Should we do this?
* The problem at hand
An observer on the path between the ABFAB client and the RP will see
things like
- NAI
- acceptor name (i.e. the service requested)
and possibly
- EAP MSK (when AAA w/o confidentiality)
- IdP x509 certificates
* Suggested solution
- Extend RFC 7055 to allow for (or require) the GSS-API initiator and
  acceptor to perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange before any other
  traffic is sent.
- This DH key is then used to derive a symmetric key used to encrypt
  context tokens.
* Changes -00 to -01
- Why this should not be done in the application tunnel.
- TLS session resumption may make the client fingerprintable (thanks
  Jim Schaad).
- Change two false statements (thanks to Jim, again).
* Open questions
- The meat, obviously :)
- Costs
  - Implementation
  - Complexity
  - Computation
  - Round trips
- Should we detect bid down attacks? Prevent them too?
- Should this be optional or not? Note complexity and bid down.
