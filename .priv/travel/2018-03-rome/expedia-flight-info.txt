         * Managing your flight experience                                           
        Here's our quick guide to managing your airline bookings.                    
                                                                                     
        Please note that your roundtrip flight consists of two one-way fares         
        which are subject to their own rules and restrictions.                       
                                                                                     
        Visit our Manage My Flight page and select your airline(s) to manage         
        baggage and extras or to check in online.                                    
                                                                                     
        Note: you'll need your reference numbers to access your bookings and         
        manage each segment of your roundtrip flight. The reference number           
        can be found on the right-hand side in your booking confirmation             
        email and on your online itinerary, next to each flight segment.             
                                                                                     
        Most airlines allow you to:                                                  
                                                                                     
        * Add Baggage/Extra Baggage/Sports Equipment (please check applicable        
          baggage policy directly with the airline for guidance on baggage           
          weight, size and security prior to departure)                              
        * Reserve a seat                                                             
        * Enter Frequent Flier Program Information                                   
        * Check in online/print boarding pass                                        
        * Enter TSA Pre-Check / Global Entry Information (where applicable)          
                                                                                     
        Always check in online and print your boarding passes where possible.        
        Your airline(s) may charge for these services and the cost may be            
        higher at the airport.                                                       
                                                                                     
        Advanced Passenger Information must be added before your flight where        
        applicable.                                                                  
         Get ready to fly                                                            
                                                                                     
         * Managing your booking                                                     
        Changes or cancellations to one of your flights usually incur a              
        penalty fee and will not impact any other flights on your booking.           
                                                                                     
        If your booking was done in the last 24 hours you may be able to             
        cancel your ticket via your online itinerary for a full refund.              
                                                                                     
        For flights booked at an earlier date, change and cancellation rules         
        vary by airline and the fare purchased. Expedia does not charge for          
        changing/cancelling a flight, but the airline may. Airline Fees for          
        changes and cancellations applicable to your fare can be accessed via        
        your online itinerary.                                                       
                                                                                     
        Many flights can be cancelled via your online itinerary. However if          
        you do not see a cancel link or if you want to change your                   
        reservation, please visit: Customer Support. Most airlines will              
        charge $150-$250 US Dollars + any applicable increase in fare.               
                                                                                     
        Take a moment to ensure your travel dates are correct and that               
        travellers' names exactly match their passport. Name corrections are         
        regulated by the airline’s penalty rules and in line with                    
        international security measures, airlines do not generally allow             
        modifications to the name. Where a name change is required, tickets          
        may need to be cancelled and re-purchased.                                   
                                                                                     
        In the event of a change to the flight schedule, we will contact you         
        by email.

        Please double check visa requirements for your destination and any           
        transit countries. It's your responsibility to make sure you bring           
        all required travel documents (such as passports and visas, including        
        transit visas) and to make sure all other entry requirements are met.        
        For some destinations, your travel documents may need to be valid for        
        a minimum of 3 to 6 months beyond your final date of travel.

        We take internet security very seriously and we have been made aware         
        of phishing scams targeting the travel industry. Expedia will never          
        request sensitive or financial information post-booking nor require          
        you to transfer money to any account via an email or SMS message.
